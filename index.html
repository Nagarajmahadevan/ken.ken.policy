        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <DEVELOPER_NAME> ("we", "our", or "us") handles information
          for the mobile game <strong>KenKen Puzzle</strong> (the "App"). The App is a math puzzle game
          with no account system, no in-app purchases, and no ads.

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect, store, or share personal information. The App can be used without creating
          an account, and it does not require you to provide any personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The App may request basic device permissions required by the Android system to function properly.
          These permissions are used only for core functionality and are not used to collect personal data.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>
          Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use or process personal data for any purpose.
          Puzzle progress and settings (if any) are stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          By default, the App does not use third-party SDKs or services for analytics, advertising, or
          crash reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you later add analytics or crash reporting, list them here:

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect information stored within the App. Since we do not
          collect personal data, there is no personal data stored on our servers.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
